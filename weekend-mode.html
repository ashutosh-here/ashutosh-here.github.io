                            <p>I like to spend my weekends relaxing and doing some things which give me positive vibes.
                                <br> These include art, watching movies, learning new languages, heading out for short trips etc. 
                                 I will try to finish the web series that I started watching way  back ago. </p>

                             <p>
                                I have two precious days that are dedicated only for me. Sometimes I start any new Project
                                or continue unifinished Projects to enhance my  technical skills.

                                There are no deadlines, pressure or stress. I can decide what I want to build and start whenever I like.
                                    Even if I haven't finished it for one weekend, nothing bad can happen. I can always continue the next. 
                                    For me personally, this part of the week has contributed the most to my personal development as a Software Developer.

 </p>    
<P>
    Also it's weekend so I can make time for family and friends. I will go out with my family for dinner  to spend quality time with them.
    One of my hobby is cycling , so occasionally I  ride my bicycle in morning for some kilometers. I like to play badminton as well .

                            <p>My hobby is riding a my motorcycle. I ride a dark orange Kawasaki W800. The engine is very powerful. <br> It is not a fashionable racing motorcycle,; it is an old styled nostalgic one. I think that my favorite uncle had a similar one when I was a child. </p>
                            <p>When I first saw the Kawasaki W800 in a motorcycle shop 6 six months ago, I fell in love with her. I felt that she was saying, “Get me, please.”. Please But Unfortunately, the price was over my budget. So, I decided to save money to get her. Finally she became mine last month. </p>
                            <p>I ride her everyday to commute. I live in Yokohama and my work place is in Tokyo. It takes about 45 minutes by using the Daisan-Keihin h Highway called Daisan-Keihin. </p>
                            <p>The faster I run ride, the more strongly the wind pushes against my body. One On the highway, It is fun though, but it is not easy.</p>
                            <p>The best season for riding a motorcycle is spring. I can feel comfortable, warm wind against my face and enjoy the cherry blossoms beside the highway.</p>
